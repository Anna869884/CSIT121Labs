	<h2>Americanized Versions</h2>
    <p>The reason I chose to share this recipe is obvious: I was born in Russia and moved to United States 18 years ago. Beef Stroganoff was always my favorite meal. My mom used to cook it for me when I was a kid and growing up I was helping her cooking this dish. I was really happy when I found out there are also Americanized Versions for this traditional beef stroganoff recipe. In Russian-American restaurants, beef stroganoff is typically served with egg noodles, but crispy pan-fried potatoes are the traditional Russian way to serve stroganoff.</p>
