	<h2>Hiking</h2>

	<p>One of my favorite things to do is Hiking. Hiking is a great social activity. My most-liked trail is <em>"King and Queens Seat Loop"</em>, located in Rocks State Park. I was introduced to this trail when I just came to US, and ever since I try to hike this trail every couple years.</p>
